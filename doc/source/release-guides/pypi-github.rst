=============================
Publish on GitHub and to PyPI
=============================

Overview
~~~~~~~~~

In this guide, you will learn to release your source code to GitHub and PyPI so that by the end of the guide, you can install your package via ``pip install <package-name>``.

Initiate a release process with GitHub issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _release-instructions-contributor:

.. important::  Make sure you have your project is standarlized with ``scikit-package`` up to Level 5. Otherwise, please start from the Overview page :ref:`here <overview>`.

#. In the repository, create an issue on GitHub with the :guilabel:`Release` option as shown below:

   .. image:: ../img/release-issue.png
      :alt: add-personal-access-token
      :width: 600px

#. Check off all items in the first checklist for PyPI/GitHub release.

#. Proceed to the next section.

Start pre-release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _release-instructions-maintainer:

#. Review the release GitHub issue created in the previous step.

#. Set ``PYPI_TOKEN`` and ``PAT_TOKEN`` are configured at the organization or repository level by following the instructions in Appendix :ref:`1 <pypi-token-setup>`, :ref:`2 <pat-token-setup>`, respectively.

#. Setup GitHub Pages at the repository level by following the instructions in Appendix :ref:`3 <gh-pages-setup>`.

#. Confirm the ``maintainer_github_username`` section in ``.github/workflows/build-wheel-release-upload.yml`` is that of the project maintainer.

#. In your terminal, run ``git checkout main && git pull upstream main`` to sync with the main branch.

#. (Optional but recommended) Install and run the ``vulture`` tool to identify and manually remove unused or dead code before tagging a release:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ conda install vulture
      $ vulture src/ tests/

   Review the output and remove or suppress unused code when it is not needed to keep the release clean and maintainable.

#. Run the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # For pre-release, use *.*.*-rc.* e.g., 1.0.0-rc.0
      # rc stands for release candidate
      $ git tag <version>-rc.<rc-number>
      $ git push upstream <version>-rc.<rc-number>

#. Done! Once the tag is pushed, visit the :guilabel:`Actions` tab in the repository to monitor the CI progress.

#. You will see that the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered and the package is built and uploaded to PyPI and GitHub.

#. For ``pre-release``, it will not update the documentation on GitHub Pages. It will also not update the changelog. See the next section for the full release process.

.. note:: 

   Did you encounter any errors in the workflow, such as permission issues? Check the solutions provided in :ref:`faq-release-ci-failed`.

Full release after pre-release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In your terminal, run ``git checkout main && git pull upstream main`` to sync with the main branch.

#. Run the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # For release, use *.*.* e.g., 1.0.0
      $ git tag <version>
      $ git push upstream <version>

#. Notice that ``CHANGELOG.rst`` is also updated with the new release version and the documentation is built under the ``gh-pages`` branch.

.. note:: 

   Did you encounter any errors in the workflow, such as issues related to ``CHANGELOG.rst``? Check the solutions provided in :ref:`faq-release-ci-failed`.

What's next? Create conda package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install your package using ``conda install <package-name>``, you can now start with the :ref:`release-conda-forge` guide!

.. _pypi-token-setup:

Appendix 1. Setup ``PYPI_TOKEN`` to allow GitHub Actions to upload to PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generate a PyPI API token from ``pypi.org``:

#. Visit https://pypi.org/manage/account/ and log in.

#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`API tokens` section and click :guilabel:`Add API token`.

#. Set the :guilabel:`Token name` to ``PYPI_TOKEN``.

#. Choose the appropriate :guilabel:`Scope` for the token.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create token` and copy the generated token.

Add the generated token to GitHub:

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Settings` page of the org (or repository).

#. Click the :guilabel:`Actions` tab under :guilabel:`Secrets and variables`.

#. Click :guilabel:`New org secret`, name it ``PYPI_TOKEN``, and paste the token value.

#. Done!

.. _pat-token-setup:

Appendix 2. Setup ``PAT_TOKEN`` to allow GitHub Actions to compile ``CHANGELOG.rst``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recall that dring a release (not pre-release) process, the GitHub Actions workflow compiles the news items in the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` file in the ``main`` branch. Hence, the GitHub workflow needs to link with this privilege through a personal access token (PAT) of the project maintainer.

1. Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. Click :guilabel:`Generate new token` and choose the classic option.

3. Under :guilabel:`Note`, write, "GitHub CI release"

4. Set the Expiration date of the token.

5. Under :guilabel:`Select scopes`, check :guilabel:`repo` and :guilabel:`user`.

6. Scroll down, click :guilabel:`Generate token`.

7. Done!

.. image:: ../img/add-personal-access-token.png
   :alt: add-personal-access-token
   :width: 600px

Copy and paste the ``PAT_TOKEN`` to your GitHub organization:

:guilabel:`Settings` in the organization.

1. Click the :guilabel:`Actions` tab under :guilabel:`Secrets and variables`.

2. Click :guilabel:`New organization secret` and add a new secret and name it as ``PAT_TOKEN``.

3. Done!

.. _gh-pages-setup:

Appendix 3. Host documentation online with GitHub Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's now host the documentation online, e.g., ``https://diffpy.github.io/diffpy.utils``, using GitHub Pages.

#. Visit :menuselection:`Settings --> Code and automation --> Pages`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Deploy from a branch` under :guilabel:`Source`.

#. Choose the :guilabel:`gh-pages` branch and :guilabel:`/(root)`

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

   .. image:: ../img/github-pages.png
      :alt: setup-github-pages-from-branch

#. Done! Wait a few minutes and visit your GitHub Pages URL!
